This repository includes run_analysis.R, which is a script that merges data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project at the UCI Machine Learning Repository to produce averages values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and standard deviation features. The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidy.csv.
